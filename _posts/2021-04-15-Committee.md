Dr. He now serves as a member of [TRB Standing Committee on Transportation Network Modeling (AEP40)](https://trb-aep40.org/).

The Transportation Network Modeling Committee (AEP40) is part of the AEP00 Section (Transportation Planning and Analysis) of the Transportation Research Board (TRB). The AEP40 committee promotes research, education, and information exchange in the broad area of transportation network modeling, an interdisciplinary field spanning transportation science, logistics, mathematics, operations research, telecommunications, and computer science.

The committee serves as the focal point on the development, adaptation, and implementation of quantitative and computer-based methodologies that enhance the understanding and modeling of:

- technological and behavioral factors affecting the performance of transportation systems;
- interactions between the infrastructure and transportation networks; and
- quantity and quality of emerging transportation services.

The committee cuts across traditional modal boundaries, seeks to unify conceptual and methodological frameworks, and fosters effective and rapid sharing of information and experiences among researchers, practitioners, regulators, and decision-makers.
