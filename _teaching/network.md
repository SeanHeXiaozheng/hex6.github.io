This is a graduate level course on fundamentals of transportation network analysis, including graph representations of transportation networks, static traffic assignment and user equilibrium, stochastic user equilibrium and dynamic traffic assignment. Basic mathematical analysis tools such as linear and nonlinear programming, nonlinear complementarity problems, and variational inequalities, will be introduced. The objective of this course is to introduce students to transportation network analysis fundamentals so that they are equipped with basic skills to conduct advanced research in this area.
