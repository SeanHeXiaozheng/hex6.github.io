This is an advanced course on fundamentals of urban traffic engineering, including data collection, analysis, design, traffic engineering studies, traffic control devices, capacity and level of service analysis of freeways and urban streets. Application of traffic operations computer simulation models to the design of isolated and coordinated traffic signal control systems will also be introduced and used in this course. The objective of this course is to introduce students to traffic engineering fundamentals for highways and freeways. Emphasis is on the safe and efficient operations of roadway intersections. State-of-the-art computer packages will be used to solve traffic engineering problems.
