Topics on traffic control systems such as signals and ramp metering; sensor-aided and data-oriented traffic modeling; fundamentals and applications of microscopic traffic simulation. State of the art signal design and traffic simulation tools will be used throughout the class.

This graduate level course focuses on advanced topics on urban traffic modeling, control, and simulation, which is divided into four parts: driving behavior algorithms, traffic control of signalized intersections, real-time traffic signal performance measurement, and microscopic traffic simulation. The first part of the course will focus on the microscopic level of vehicular dynamics and the computer algorithms to describe the interactions among vehicles and traffic signal control. The second part of the course will discuss the important concepts and basic design procedures for fixed time and actuated signals at isolated intersections, and coordination of traffic signals in an urban corridor. The third part of the course will cover performance measurements of traffic signals and urban corridors, especially on the traffic efficiency and sustainability. The fourth part of the course will cover microscopic traffic simulation including fundamental concepts and applications of the state-of-the-practice micro-simulation products in the market. This course is intended for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students with a solid background on the basics of transportation and traffic engineering (see prerequisites). Traffic control and simulation software packages will be introduced in the class and will be used to model real world traffic intersections and corridors. The course is also intended to be “project-based.” Real life applications such as signal design, signal and arterial performance evaluation, and traffic simulation will be studied throughout the semester. The emphasis of the course is primarily on analyses of traffic signal control and the use of traffic simulation to evaluate the performance of urban transportation systems. Some basic programming knowledge may be required for homework assignments and course projects.
