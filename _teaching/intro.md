Introduction to basic concepts in transportation engineering including planning, design, and operations. Introduces the challenges and issues in modeling transportation problems. Studies of various concepts related to the design of highway facilities, level of service, and demand for transportation services. Concepts related to signal optimization. Policy implications. Basics of transportation planning.

This course is mainly oriented toward engineering students interested in learning the fundamentals of how transportation systems are designed, planned, and operated. This course is intended as an introductory transportation class for all interested engineering and science students. The course is structured upon the basic objective to motivate students to pursue a deeper understanding of transportation systems. To facilitate this, the course requires the students to have some confidence in basic computer skills such as spreadsheets (excel), data analysis, and basic undergraduate mathematics and physics. Students are expected to actively participate in the class. Experiential learning and teamwork is emphasized throughout the course.
